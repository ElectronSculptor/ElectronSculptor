<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm Gevorg 👨‍💻</h1>

<p align="center">
Engineering student specializing in microelectronics and computer science at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne (ISMIN).
</p>

<p align="center">
  Passionate about Hardware, Processor design, and developing innovative projects.
  It all started in 2021 when I repaired a GTX 960. From that day on, I've been completely passionate about Hardware, and hope to become a **Processor Designer** in the future.
  I'm looking for an **internship** of at least 4 months from april 2025 in Europe, in the microelectronics field.
